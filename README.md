# Summary of the Project
ïƒ˜	I used Python's requests library to paginate through GitHub's REST API and retrieve all Chicago-based users with 100+ followers. Further, I collected their repositories. The data is saved in CSV format on Google Drive. Also performed data cleaning on certain fields, like company names and those holding boolean data types.
